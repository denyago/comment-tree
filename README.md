Learning Kotlin by implementing a simple comments tree with HTTP client calls. Inspired by https://habr.com/ru/post/469441/

The task is following:

- Given a tree with an Integer IDs in each node
- Fetch the comments by IDs from an API asynchronously
- And display the new tree with comments

It is supposed to be an "expressiveness test" of *your* favourite language.

To me it's a way to learn something new.
